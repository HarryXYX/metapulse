We will expand this\n    aspect to other entities eventually.\nThe values of the documentation are not currently searchable. This will be\n    changed once this aspect develops opinion on which documentation entry is\n    the authoritative one.\nEnsuring that there is only one documentation per source is a business\n    rule that is not enforced by the aspect yet. This will currently be enforced by the\n    application that uses this aspect. We will eventually enforce this rule in\n    the aspect using AspectMutators.",
