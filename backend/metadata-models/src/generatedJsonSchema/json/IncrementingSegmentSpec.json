A field or column that represents the incrementing value. New rows that are inserted will be identified using this column.\n    Note that the value of this column may not by itself represent the \"bucket\" or the \"segment\" in which the row falls.\n\n 2. [Optional] An transformer function that may be applied to the selected column value in order\n    to obtain the final \"segment identifier\" or \"bucket identifier\". Rows that have the same value after applying the transformation\n    will be grouped into the same segment, using which the final value (e.g. row count) will be determined.",
